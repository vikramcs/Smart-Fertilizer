India is an agriculture based economy whose most of the GDP comes from farming. In an economy where most of the produced food is from agriculture, selection of crop(s) plays a very important role. In light of the decreasing crop produce and shortage of food across the country which also has been consequence of bad crop selection and thus, leading to increasing farmer suicides. Different seasons, market and Biological Patterns influence the crop production, but because of changes in these patterns result in an excellent loss to farmers. 
This Project suggest a method which would help to suggest the most suitable crop(s) which will maximize yield by summing up the analysis of all the affecting parameters.  These affecting parameters can be economical, environmental as well as related to yield in nature. Economic factors such as market prices, demand etc. play a very significant role in deciding a crop(s) as does the environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil type and its chemical composition and total produce. Therefore, itâ€™s necessary to design a system taking into consideration all the affecting parameters for the better selection of crop(s) which can be grown over the season.
